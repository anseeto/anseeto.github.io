                    I am a Waterloo Warrior Alum and I graduated with a Bachelor of Applied Science (BASc.) in Computer Engineering. The Honours Computer Engineering program at the University of Waterloo has a mandatory 5 (optional 6) co-operative education terms where I obtained valuable work experience. I graduated with an overall average of 73%. My transcript may be found <a href="Transcript.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.

                    As a hardware verification engineer, I would validate any and all circuitry both on the theoretical schematic and on the real boards. These circuits ranged from switched mode power supplies (SMPS), buck and boost circuits, linear regulators, and serial communication interfaces. I performed line and load regulation as well as temperature testing on the power circuits. I assisted software teams by soldering specific hardware configurations for testing and created test adapters for peripheral emulation. Lastly, I helped debug any and all issues by analyzing the necessary digital and analog signals to find the root of the issues.

                    As a skating and hockey instructor, I would run multiple sessions of skating and hockey instruction per week for other Univeristy of Waterloo students. I would prepare a lesson plan prior to each session that would progressively increase in difficulty each week. The sessions taught were a beginner and advanced skating session and a beginner and advanced hockey skills and drills session.

                    I worked on a small team of 6 people at LotLinx so I provided multiple roles as a Junior Developer and QA Analyst. I would develop Java processes to analyze data artifacts received from customers. I overlooked production level processes across different servers and created cron jobs to clean up and organize those server storages. I maintained and created JUnit tests and used Jenkins to run the tests and other processes. Lastly, I implemented a central log management system for dynamic log notifications via e-mail.
